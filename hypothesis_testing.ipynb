    "\n",
    "A **statistical hypothesis test** is a method of [statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference \"Statistical inference\") used to determine a possible conclusion from two different, and likely conflicting, hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statistical hypothesis test, a [null hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis \"Null hypothesis\") and an [alternative hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_hypothesis \"Alternative hypothesis\") is proposed for the probability distribution of the data. If the sample obtained has a probability of occurrence less than the pre-specified threshold probability, the [significance level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significance_level \"Significance level\"), given the null hypothesis is true, the difference between the sample and the null hypothesis is deemed [_statistically significant_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistically_significant \"Statistically significant\"). The hypothesis test may then lead to the rejection of null hypothesis and acceptance of alternate hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of distinguishing between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis is aided by considering [Type I error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors \"Type I and type II errors\") and [Type II error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors \"Type I and type II errors\") which are controlled by the pre-specified significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis tests based on statistical significance are another way of expressing [confidence intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval \"Confidence interval\") (more precisely, confidence sets). In other words, every hypothesis test based on significance can be obtained via a confidence interval, and every confidence interval can be obtained via a hypothesis test based on significance.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing#cite_note-1)"
