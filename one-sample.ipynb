    "A **statistical hypothesis test** is a method of [statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference \"Statistical inference\") used to determine a possible conclusion from two different, and likely conflicting, hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statistical hypothesis test, a [null hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis \"Null hypothesis\") and an [alternative hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_hypothesis \"Alternative hypothesis\") is proposed for the probability distribution of the data. If the sample obtained has a probability of occurrence less than the pre-specified threshold probability, the [significance level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significance_level \"Significance level\"), given the null hypothesis is true, the difference between the sample and the null hypothesis is deemed [_statistically significant_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistically_significant \"Statistically significant\"). The hypothesis test may then lead to the rejection of null hypothesis and acceptance of alternate hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of distinguishing between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis is aided by considering [Type I error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors \"Type I and type II errors\") and [Type II error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors \"Type I and type II errors\") which are controlled by the pre-specified significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis tests based on statistical significance are another way of expressing [confidence intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval \"Confidence interval\") (more precisely, confidence sets). In other words, every hypothesis test based on significance can be obtained via a confidence interval, and every confidence interval can be obtained via a hypothesis test based on significance.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing#cite_note-1)"

    "\n",
    "In [statistical hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing \"Statistical hypothesis testing\"), a **type I error** is the mistaken rejection of an actually true [null hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis \"Null hypothesis\") (also known as a \"false positive\" finding or conclusion; example: \"an innocent person is convicted\"), while a **type II error** is the failure to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false (also known as a \"false negative\" finding or conclusion; example: \"a guilty person is not convicted\"). Much of statistical theory revolves around the minimization of one or both of these errors, though the complete elimination of either is a statistical impossibility if the outcome is not determined by a known, observable causal process. By selecting a low threshold (cut-off) value and modifying the alpha (α) level, the quality of the hypothesis test can be increased. The knowledge of Type I errors and Type II errors is widely used in [medical science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_science \"Medical science\"), [biometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics \"Biometrics\") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\").\n",

    "Significance tests often use a significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$, but in some cases it makes sense to use a different significance level. Changing $\\alpha$ impacts the probabilities of Type I and Type II errors. In some tests, one kind of error has more serious consequences than the other.

Lower values of $\\alpha$ make it harder to reject the null hypothesis, so choosing lower values for $\\alpha$ can reduce the probability of a Type I error. The consequence here is that if the null hypothesis is false, it may be more difficult to reject using a low value for $\\alpha$. So using lower values of $\\alpha$ can increase the probability of a Type II error.\n",

Higher values of $\\alpha$ make it easier to reject the null hypothesis, so choosing higher values for $\\alpha$ can reduce the probability of a Type II error.

    "\n",
    "When we want to carry out inferences on one proportion (build a confidence interval or do a significance test), the accuracy of our methods depend on a few conditions. Before doing the actual computations of the interval or test, it's important to check whether or not these conditions have been met, otherwise the calculations and conclusions that follow aren't actually valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditions we need for inference on one proportion are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random**: The data needs to come from a random sample or randomized experiment.\n",
    "- **Normal**: The sampling distribution of $\\hat p$ needs to be approximately normal — needs at least $10$ expected successes and $10$ expected failures.\n",
    "- **Independent**: Individual observations need to be independent. If sampling without replacement, our sample size shouldn't be more than $10\\%$ of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The random condition\n",
    "\n",
    "Random samples give us unbiased data from a population. When samples aren't randomly selected, the data usually has some form of bias, so using data that wasn't randomly selected to make inferences about its population can be risky.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, sample proportions are unbiased estimators of their population proportion. For example, if we have a bag of candy where $50\\%$ of the candies are orange and we take random samples from the bag, some will have more than $50\\%$ orange and some will have less. But on average, the proportion of orange candies in each sample will equal $50\\%$. We write this property as $\\mu_{\\hat p}=p$, which holds true as long as our sample is random.\n",
    "\n",
    "This won't necessarily happen if our sample isn't randomly selected though. Biased samples lead to inaccurate results, so they shouldn't be used to create confidence intervals or carry out significance tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The normal condition\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling distribution of $\\hat p$ is approximately normal as long as the expected number of successes and failures are both at least $10$. This happens when our sample size $n$ is reasonably large. The proof of this is beyond the scope of AP statistics, but our tutorial on sampling distributions can provide some intuition and verification that this condition indeed works.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\displaystyle \\text{expected success: } np \\geq 10$\n",
    "- $\\displaystyle \\text{expected failures: } n(1 - p) \\geq 10$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are building a confidence interval, we don't have a value of $p$ to plug in, so we instead count the observed number of successes and failures in the sample data to make sure they are both at least $10$. If we are doing a significance test, we use our sample size $n$ and the hypothesized value of $p$ to calculate our expected numbers of successes and failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The independence condition\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the formula for standard deviation of $\\hat p$, we need individual observations to be independent. When we are sampling without replacement, individual observations aren't technically independent since removing each item changes the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the $10\\%$ condition says that if we sample $10\\%$ or less of the population, we can treat individual observations as independent since removing each observation doesn't significantly change the population as we sample. For instance, if our sample size is $n=150$, there should be at least $N=1500$ members in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to use the formula for standard deviation of $\\hat p$:\n",

    "$\\displaystyle \\sigma_{\\hat p} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$\n",

    "A **test statistic** is a [statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic \"Statistic\") (a quantity derived from the [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics) \"Sample (statistics)\")) used in [statistical hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing \"Statistical hypothesis testing\").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_statistic#cite_note-CasellaBerger-1) A hypothesis test is typically specified in terms of a test statistic, considered as a numerical summary of a data-set that reduces the data to one value that can be used to perform the hypothesis test. In general, a test statistic is selected or defined in such a way as to quantify, within observed data, behaviours that would distinguish the [null](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis \"Null hypothesis\") from the [alternative hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_hypothesis \"Alternative hypothesis\"), where such an alternative is prescribed, or that would characterize the null hypothesis if there is no explicitly stated alternative hypothesis.\n",

    "When we want to carry out inference (build a confidence interval or do a significance test) on a mean, the accuracy of our methods depends on a few conditions. Before doing the actual computations of the interval or test, it's important to check whether or not these conditions have been met. Otherwise the calculations and conclusions that follow may not be correct.\n",

    "The conditions we need for inference on a mean are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Random**: A random sample or randomized experiment should be used to obtain the data.\n",
    "-   **Normal**: The sampling distribution of $\\bar x$ (the sample mean) needs to be approximately normal. This is true if our parent population is normal or if our sample is reasonably large $(n \\geq 30)$.\n",
    "-   **Independent**: Individual observations need to be independent. If sampling without replacement, our sample size shouldn't be more than $10\\%$ of the population.\n",

    "\n",
    "Random samples give us unbiased data from a population. When we don't use random selection, the resulting data usually has some form of bias, so using it to infer something about the population can be risky.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, sample means are unbiased estimators of their population mean. For example, suppose we have a bag of ping pong balls individually numbered from $0$ to $30$, so the population mean of the bag is $15$. We could take random samples of balls from the bag and calculate the mean from each sample. Some samples would have a mean higher than $15$ and some would be lower. But on average, the mean of each sample will equal $15$. We write this property as $\\mu_{\\bar x}=\\mu$, which holds true as long as we are taking random samples.\n",

    "### The normal condition\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling distribution of $\\bar x$ (a sample mean) is approximately normal in a few different cases. The shape of the sampling distribution of $\\bar x$ mostly depends on the shape of the parent population and the sample size $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 1: Parent population is normally distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "If the parent population is normally distributed, then the sampling distribution of $\\bar x$ is approximately normal regardless of sample size. So if we know that the parent population is normally distributed, we pass this condition even if the sample size is small. In practice, however, we usually don't know if the parent population is normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 2: Not normal or unknown parent population; sample size is large $(n \\geq 30)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling distribution of $\\bar x$ is approximately normal as long as the sample size is reasonably large. Because of the central limit theorem, when $n \\geq 30$, we can treat the sampling distribution of $\\bar x$ as approximately normal regardless of the shape of the parent population.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few rare cases where the parent population has such an unusual shape that the sampling distribution of the sample mean $\\bar x$ isn't quite normal for sample sizes near $30$. These cases are rare, so in practice, we are usually safe to assume approximately normality in the sampling distribution when $n \\geq 30$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 3: Not normal or unknown parent population; sample size is small $(n<30)$\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the parent population doesn't have outliers or strong skew, even smaller samples will produce a sampling distribution of $\\bar x$ that is approximately normal. In practice, we can't usually see the shape of the parent population, but we can try to infer shape based on the distribution of data in the sample. If the data in the sample shows skew or outliers, we should doubt that the parent is approximately normal, and so the sampling distribution of $\\bar x$ may not be normal either. But if the sample data are roughly symmetric and don't show outliers or strong skew, we can assume that the sampling distribution of $\\bar x$ will be approximately normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "_The big idea is that we need to graph our sample data when $n<30$ and then make a decision about the normal condition based on the appearance of the sample data._\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The independence condition\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the formula for standard deviation of $\\bar x$, we need individual observations to be independent. In an experiment, good design usually takes care of independence between subjects (control, different treatments, randomization).\n",
    "\n",
    "In an observational study that involves sampling without replacement, individual observations aren't technically independent since removing each observation changes the population. However the $10\\%$ condition says that if we sample $10\\%$ or less of the population, we can treat individual observations as independent since removing each observation doesn't change the population all that much as we sample. For instance, if our sample size is $n=30$, there should to be at least $N=300$ members in the population for the sample to meet the independence condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming independence between observations allows us to use this formula for standard deviation of $\\bar x$ when we're making confidence intervals or doing significance tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\sigma_{\\bar x} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually don't know the population standard deviation $\\sigma$, so we substitute the sample standard deviation $s_x$ as an estimate for $\\sigma$. When we do this, we call it the **standard error** of $\\bar x$ to distinguish it from the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our formula for standard error of $\\bar x$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\sigma_{\\bar x} \\approx \\frac{s_x}{\\sqrt{n}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If all three of these conditions are met, then we can we feel good about using $t$ distributions to make a confidence interval or do a significance test. Satisfying these conditions makes our calculations accurate and conclusions reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random condition is perhaps the most important. If we break the random condition, there is probably bias in the data. The only reliable way to correct for a biased sample is to recollect the data in an unbiased way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two conditions are important, but if we don't meet the normal or independence conditions, we may not need to start over. For example, there is a way to correct for the lack of independence when we sample more than $10\\%$ of a population, but it's beyond the scope of what we're learning right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that it's important to verify certain conditions are met before we make these confidence intervals or do these significance tests."
