    "> In [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory \"Probability theory\") and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics \"Statistics\"), a **probability mass function** is a function that gives the probability that a [discrete random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_random_variable \"Discrete random variable\") is exactly equal to some value.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function#cite_note-1) Sometimes it is also known as the discrete density function. The probability mass function is often the primary means of defining a [discrete probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_probability_distribution \"Discrete probability distribution\"), and such functions exist for either [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_variable \"Scalar variable\") or [multivariate random variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_random_variable \"Multivariate random variable\") whose [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function \"Domain of a function\") is discrete.<br>\n",
    "> A probability mass function differs from a [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) (PDF) in that the latter is associated with continuous rather than discrete random variables. A PDF must be [integrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_(mathematics) \"Integration (mathematics)\") over an interval to yield a probability.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function#cite_note-:0-2)<br>\n",
    "> The value of the random variable having the largest probability mass is called the [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics) \"Mode (statistics)\").\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function)<br>\n",
    "> In [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory \"Probability theory\") and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics \"Statistics\"), the **cumulative distribution function** (**CDF**) of a real-valued [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable \"Random variable\") ${\\displaystyle X}$, or just **distribution function** of ${\\displaystyle X}$, evaluated at ${\\displaystyle x}$ that ${\\displaystyle X}$ will take a value less than or equal to ${\\displaystyle x}$.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function#cite_note-1)<br>\n",
    "> In the case of a scalar [continuous distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_distribution \"Continuous distribution\"), it gives the area under the [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function \"Probability density function\") from minus infinity to ${\\displaystyle x}$. Cumulative distribution functions are also used to specify the distribution of [multivariate random variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_random_variable \"Multivariate random variable\").\n",
