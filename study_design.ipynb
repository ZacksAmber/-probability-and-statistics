    "\n",
    "**Simple random sample:** Every member and set of members has an equal chance of being included in the sample. Technology, random number generators, or some other sort of chance process is needed to get a simple random sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example—A teachers puts students' names in a hat and chooses without looking to get a sample of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it's good: Random samples are usually fairly representative since they don't favor certain members.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stratified random sample:** The population is first split into groups. The overall sample consists of some members from every group. The members from each group are chosen randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example—A student council surveys $100$ students by getting random samples of $25$ freshmen, $25$ sophomores, $25$ juniors, and $25$ seniors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it's good: A stratified sample guarantees that members from each group will be represented in the sample, so this sampling method is good when we want some members from every group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cluster random sample:** The population is first split into groups. The overall sample consists of every member from some of the groups. The groups are selected at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example—An airline company wants to survey its customers one day, so they randomly select $5$ flights that day and survey every passenger on those flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it's good: A cluster sample gets every member from some of the groups, so it's good when each group reflects the population as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Systematic random sample:** Members of the population are put in some order. A starting point is selected at random, and every $n^{\\text{th}}$ member is selected to be in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example—A principal takes an alphabetized list of student names and picks a random starting point. Every $20^{\\text{th}}$ student is selected to take a survey."
