    "### Good ways to sample\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple random sample:** Every member and set of members has an equal chance of being included in the sample. Technology, random number generators, or some other sort of chance process is needed to get a simple random sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example—A teachers puts students' names in a hat and chooses without looking to get a sample of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it's good: Random samples are usually fairly representative since they don't favor certain members.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stratified random sample:** The population is first split into groups. The overall sample consists of some members from every group. The members from each group are chosen randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example—A student council surveys $100$ students by getting random samples of $25$ freshmen, $25$ sophomores, $25$ juniors, and $25$ seniors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it's good: A stratified sample guarantees that members from each group will be represented in the sample, so this sampling method is good when we want some members from every group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cluster random sample:** The population is first split into groups. The overall sample consists of every member from some of the groups. The groups are selected at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example—An airline company wants to survey its customers one day, so they randomly select $5$ flights that day and survey every passenger on those flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it's good: A cluster sample gets every member from some of the groups, so it's good when each group reflects the population as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Systematic random sample:** Members of the population are put in some order. A starting point is selected at random, and every $n^{\\text{th}}$ member is selected to be in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example—A principal takes an alphabetized list of student names and picks a random starting point. Every $20^{\\text{th}}$ student is selected to take a survey."

    "## Errors in sample surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "Survey results are typically subject to some error. Total errors can be classified into sampling errors and non-sampling errors. The term \"error\" here includes systematic biases as well as random errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling errors and biases\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling errors and biases are induced by the sample design. They include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **[Selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias \"Selection bias\")**: When the true selection probabilities differ from those assumed in calculating the results.\n",
    "2.  **[Random sampling error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_error \"Sampling error\")**: Random variation in the results due to the elements in the sample being selected at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-sampling error\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-sampling errors are other errors which can impact final survey estimates, caused by problems in data collection, processing, or sample design. Such errors may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Over-coverage**: inclusion of data from outside of the population\n",
    "2.  **Under-coverage**: sampling frame does not include elements in the population.\n",
    "3.  **Measurement error**: e.g. when respondents misunderstand a question, or find it difficult to answer\n",
    "4.  **Processing error**: mistakes in data coding\n",
    "5.  **[Non-response or Participation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_bias \"Participation bias\")**: failure to obtain complete data from all selected individuals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Biased wording of survey questions can cause people to favor certain responses over others. Suggesting that smoking is illegal might make it less likely for students who smoke to admit they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Response bias is when people are systematically dishonest when answering a question. High school students who smoke aren't likely to admit it to their counselor. At the same time, it's doubtful that students would lie in the other direction—students who don't smoke probably wouldn't say that they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonresponse is when people chosen for the sample cannot be reached or refuse to participate. In this scenario, a large majority of people did not respond to the phone calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Undercoverage is when the researcher systematically excludes members of the population from being in the sample. Random digit dialing will reach people with mobile phones and unlisted numbers, but people without phones are excluded from the sample. This might be an issue, but it doesn't seem as concerning as the very high rate of nonresponse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Response bias isn't as concerning as a nonresponse rate of more than $90\\%$, although it is possible that people may be concerned about privacy just from getting the phone call."
