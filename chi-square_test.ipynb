    "Suppose that $n$ observations in a random sample from a population are classified into $k$ mutually exclusive classes with respective observed numbers $x_i$ (for $i = 1,2,…,k$), and a null hypothesis gives the probability $p_i$ that an observation falls into the $i^{th}$ class.

    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\chi^2 = \\sum^{k}_{i=1} \\frac{(x_i - m_i)^2}{m_i} = \\sum^{k}_{i=1} \\frac{x_{i}^{2}}{m_i} - n$\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression on the right is of the form that [Karl Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson \"Karl Pearson\") would generalize to the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\chi^2 = \\sum^{n}_{i=1} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\displaystyle \\chi ^{2}}$ = Pearson's cumulative test statistic, which asymptotically approaches a ${\\displaystyle \\chi ^{2}}$ distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\displaystyle O_{i}}$ = the number of observations of type ${\\displaystyle i}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "${\\displaystyle n}$ = the number of cells in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a binomial outcome (flipping a coin), the binomial distribution may be approximated by a normal distribution (for sufficiently large ${\\displaystyle n}$. Because the square of a standard normal distribution is the chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, the probability of a result such as 1 heads in 10 trials can be approximated either by using the normal distribution directly, or the chi-squared distribution for the normalised, squared difference between observed and expected value. However, many problems involve more than the two possible outcomes of a binomial, and instead require 3 or more categories, which leads to the multinomial distribution. Just as de Moivre and Laplace sought for and found the normal approximation to the binomial, Pearson sought for and found a degenerate multivariate normal approximation to the multinomial distribution (the numbers in each category add up to the total sample size, which is considered fixed). Pearson showed that the chi-squared distribution arose from such a multivariate normal approximation to the multinomial distribution, taking careful account of the statistical dependence (negative correlations) between numbers of observations in different categories."
